# Assignment 0 Hello Web

To be prepared for this class, you will want to familiarize yourself with HTML5, CSS/CSS3, and Javascript/JS. At one point, this material was effectively its own course (CINS110, a prerequisite to CINS465); however, CINS110 has been removed as a prerequisite, so you are responsible for learning HTML5, CSS, and JS mostly on your own. This material is important to being successful with web programming, but most class time will be focused on applying these tools in relation to the web framework used in this class.
